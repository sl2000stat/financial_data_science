    "Our BSc course on Financial Data Science is time constrained. There is no time to teach option pricing. Yet, we can take a realistic parametrization of a stock return and simulate it to learn about diffusive risks and jump risks. The latter is also called crash risks or non-Gaussian discretionary moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prof. Merton, a Nobel Laureate in Economics, and industrial engineer by training, described stock returns to follow a mix of a Gaussian distribution and a Poisson distribution. The Gaussian distribution captures the normal randomness in stock returns. The infrequent, yet, dramatic up and down jumps in stock returns are modelled by a Poisson shock. Prof. Merton derived the price of an option on such a realistic stock return dynamic. That derivation, among other work, was reason to award him with a Nobel Prize in Economics. It also created a new field called \"financial engineering\". Financial data science benefits from the last thirty years of option pricing. I reveal some of these during an upcoming Masters course on Financial Machine Learning. Yet, for the moment, I want to use Merton's parametrization of stock returns to show you how much you have already learned in this course.\n",

    "Our battle plan is as follows: First I quickly introduce Merton's Jump-Diffusion Model. Second, we code a function in Python that simulates the Merton’s Stock Price Process. Third, we code a Python function for a payoff of a call and put option. Fourth, we code a Python function that determines the price of that call and put contract. That pricing relies on simulating the density of future stock prices. "

    "Prof Merton introduced stochastic calculus to financial economics. This follows the tradition of Albert Einstein to model randomness across time by means of an ordinary differential equation plus noise (= stochastic differential equation). An upcoming MSc course on Financial Machine learning offers an introduction to that. For this BSc course, I will do the calculus for you and provide you with the probability density function that Prof. Merton worked with. Intuitively, the density has a diffusive component called $Z_1$ and a jump component called $K$. $Z_1$ follows a standard normal distribution. $K$ follows a Poisson distribution with intensity factor $\\lambda$. For a definition of a Possion distribution see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution. The standard deviation of the diffusive shock is  $\\sigma \\sqrt{T}$. It is also assumed that once a jump happens, the resulting return is drawn from another Gaussian shock $Z_2$. $Z_2$ is a standard normal shock which is independent of $Z_1$. The standard deviation of the jump shock is termed $b\\sqrt{KT}$, where $b$  is the standard deviation of the jump size distribution and $K$ is the random draw of the above mentioned Poisson distriubtion that counts the number of random return jumps per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting description of the continuously compounded stock return for the holding period $0$ to $T$ reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\ln \\frac{S_T}{S_0} = (r - \\lambda a - 0.5 \\sigma^2) T + \\sigma \\sqrt{T} Z_1 + a K T + b \\sqrt{K T} Z_2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S_T$ is the price of a stock at time $T$, $r$ is the short-term risk-free rate, $\\lambda$ is the expected number of jumps per year, $a$ is the expected return impact of a jump, $0.5 \\sigma^2$ is a convexity adjustment (as we work with log returns), $\\sigma \\sqrt{T} Z_1 \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 T)$ is the diffusive return shock, $aKT + b\\sqrt{KT} Z_2|_{K} \\sim N(aKT, b^2 KT)$, conditional on knowing the realized value of $K$, captures the return innovation due to $K$ realized price jumps between the time points $0$ and $T$. Notice, that $K$ itself is a draw from a Poisson distribution, $K \\sim Pois(\\lambda)$ where you can treat $\\lambda$ as the expected number of jumps per year. \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you might have wondered correctly, why there is no risk premium on top of the risk-free rate. That question is spot on. For now, I simply assumed it to be zero. That is not a realistic assumption, yet, for my simulation task it would only affect the expected value of $S_T$. The reason why I assumed it zero here, is that in order to explain it accurately, I would have to teach you the logic behind option pricing, which relies on either hedging arguments or some basic measure theory. I will do so in the MSc course on Financial Machine Learning. For now, simply think about a stock with a zero equity risk premium."

Let me tell you that these numbers incorporate investor's priced-in risk premium. It relates to my explanations on the Gordon Growth model, yet, it is slightly more delicate. A precise explanation of that mechanism will be offered in the MSc course on Financial Machine Learning. For now, it suffices to realize that the parameters $\\lambda$, $a$, $b$ are adjusted by risk premium (which is the result of investor's risk aversion)."

    "In a nutshell, a European call (put) option gives the holder the RIGHT to buy (sell) the underlying stock at time $T$ for a prespecified price $X$. Note, $X$ is called \"exercise price\" or \"strike\". Both X and $T$ are set and known at time $t=0$ and kept constant throughout the life of the option. \n",

    "Notice, if $S_T > X$, a holder of a call option would exerice the option at $T$ and get the stock for a price of $X$. He could instantly sell it in the market for $S_T$ and pocket the postive gain of $S_T - X$. On the other hand, the holder of the put option would not exercise the put option as he/she could sell the stock for $S_T > X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if $S_T < X$, the holder of a put option would exercise the RIGHT to sell the stock for $X$, while buying it in the (so called) spot market (equity market) for $S_T$. The spread of $X - S_T$ would be the profit at time $T$ for the investor who exercises the put option.\n",

Now, we simply compute the resulting payoff of a call and put option if a particular $S_T$ gets realized. For the discount rate, we discount by the risk-free rate only. Again, a precise explanation of why in that case we only discount by $r$ will be offered in the MSc course on Financial Machine Learning.
